## Note about the assignment

It took me a bit longer than 3 hours because modifying the data was new to me, I'm not used to working with data that needs mapping in the front-end part. Also I made this using Angular 19, which is new to me. After 3 hours I had most of the component structure ready and was finishing up the data mapping. It took me a couple hours longer to finish all the features and styling.
